/**
 * Who the student is, in the few lines a model needs to answer as though it knew them.
 *
 * Retrieval alone cannot answer "when is my lecture?" or "who teaches this?" — the
 * answer is not in any group message, it is in the student's own record. Without this
 * block the model has a pile of quotations and no idea whose they are, so it either
 * refuses a question it could answer or invents the missing half.
 *
 * Deliberately short. This is prepended to every answered question, so it has to earn
 * its tokens: what they take, what is on today, what is next, and which courses
 * Peermate cannot hear about at all.
